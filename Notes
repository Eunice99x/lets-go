- the html/template package is so big, i need a whole study sessions for it if i want to master it n expand my knowledge about SSR

- Note: When we check the length of the title field, we’re using the
  utf8.RuneCountInString() function — not Go’s len() function. This will count the
  number of Unicode code points in the title rather than the number of bytes. To
  illustrate the difference, the string "Zoë" contains 3 Unicode code points, but 4 bytes
  because of the umlauted ë character.
